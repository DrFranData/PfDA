      "1. **Missing values** were addressed in several columns:\n",
      "   - `cabin`: Filled with the string `'None'` to indicate missing cabin info.\n",
      "   - `age`: Filled with the **mean age** of all passengers.\n",
      "   - `embarked`: Filled with the **most common port** (mode).\n",
      "   - `fare`: Imputed with the **median fare** for passengers of the same class and embarkation point.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feature Engineering** included:\n",
      "   - Extracting the `title` (e.g., Mr, Miss, etc.) from the `name` column.\n",
      "   - Standardizing rare and variant titles into broader categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sanity checks**:\n",
      "   - Verified that there are no remaining missing values in the dataset.\n",
